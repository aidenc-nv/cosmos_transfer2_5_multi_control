A realistic, static full-body shot of a young man standing in the center of a spacious, modern atrium. He has short dark hair and is dressed casually in a dark grey t-shirt, loose black pants, and white sneakers, with an ID badge clipped to his waistband. He faces the camera directly and waves his right hand continuously in a friendly greeting. The surrounding space is bright and open, featuring a high industrial-style ceiling with exposed white beams and large, angular black structural supports. The floor is polished light grey concrete, subtly reflecting the warm, soft afternoon sunlight that pours in from large windows above. The overall lighting has a gentle golden tint, with natural shadows stretching slightly to the side in the way they do during late afternoon. In the background, a mezzanine level with glass railings is visible, along with several modern wooden benches and tables scattered throughout the area.
