The warehouse is lit by warm sunlight filtering through windows behind the camera. The floor is beautiful rich walnut flooring. The robot is made of brushed aluminium. Some green boxes are stacked on the left side of the warehouse. Everything in the warehouse is well organized and tidy.","negative_prompt":"The video captures a game playing, with bad crappy graphics and cartoonish frames. It represents a recording of old outdated games. The lighting looks very fake. The textures are very raw and basic. The geometries are very primitive. The images are very pixelated and of poor CG quality. There are many subtitles in the footage. Overall, the video is unrealistic at all.","seed":2025,"guidance":7,"video_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/cosmos-robotics-sa-training/assets/omniverse_assets/humanoid/rgb.mp4","image_context_path":null,"num_conditional_frames":1,"resolution":"720","sigma_max":null,"num_video_frames_per_chunk":93,"num_steps":35,"show_control_condition":false,"show_input":false,"keep_input_resolution":true,"edge":{"control_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/cosmos-robotics-sa-training/assets/omniverse_assets/humanoid/edges.mp4","control_weight":1.0,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":null,"preset_edge_threshold":"medium"},"depth":{"control_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/cosmos-robotics-sa-training/assets/omniverse_assets/humanoid/depth.mp4","control_weight":0.9,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":null},"vis":null,"seg":{"control_path":"/home/nvidia/workspace/cosmos-robotics-sa-training/assets/omniverse_assets/humanoid/segmentation.mp4","control_weight":0.9,"mask_path":null,"mask_prompt":"battered orange safety cone","control_prompt":null}}
